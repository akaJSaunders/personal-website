    <h1>This is an about page</h1>

    <p>As a Senior Backend Engineer at Thriva, I am passionate about designing and building backend solutions that help users improve their health and engage with our web and mobile applications.</p>
    <p>I work in the Product Experience team, where I collaborate with other engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver high-quality and user-centric features and products.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Some of the B2C projects that I have contributed to include building Health Plans, a personalized and flexible subscription service that allows users to monitor and manage their health goals; designing and implementing a digital currency, which rewards users for their health actions and can be used to purchase products and services from our shop; and continuously improving our shop infrastructure, which integrates with Stripe and Prismic CMS to provide a seamless and secure checkout experience.</p>
    <p>I use Ruby on Rails, OpenAPI Specification, and other technologies to create scalable, reliable, and maintainable backend systems.</p>
